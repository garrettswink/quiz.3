# Javascript Quiz v.3

## Dev Notes
This assignment has been a real rubber-hitting-the-road scenario for me with JS. I had several false starts with this project but was ultimately able to build out the JS code via standard documentation sources like MDN and W3. Additionally, I worked with a tutor to revise and consolidate my code. 

In reviewing the acceptance criteria, I realized  I still need to add a function that will trigger a 'Game Over' screen if the clock hits zero, as well as save player initials and score.

However, considering the amount of time it took to get the code into its current shape, I wanted to re-submit for feedback and table this assignment for a few days while I get caught up on other boot camp activities. 

Any feedback you might have would be greatly appreciated. Likewise, any thoughts you might have about incorporating the score and name-save functionality as I head into my final draft would be fantastic.  

I'll turn a final version in ASAP upon receiving 2nd round of feedback. 

Thanks in advance,
